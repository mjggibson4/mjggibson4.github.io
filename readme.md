# Population Model

## Description

This python based project a basic agents based model of predator prey dynamics. This this scenario these two competing agents have been defined as the of sheep and wolves. These agents move randomly around a defined domain and are allowed to interact with one another. In particular, these sheep agents "graze" their spatial eniviroment while the wolves if close enough consume these sheep. Both of these agents reproduce dependent on the resources on which they have consumed. This model provides a visual representation of these spatial dynamics and behaviours.

## Prerequesits

Before this project can be ran, a suitable python enivironment must first be in place. This project was used using the data science platform Anaconda. This package is free and includes the integrated development environment Spyder 3.3.6 on which this project was written. A installation guide to Anaconda alongside installation instructions can be found here: 
[install guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/ "")


## Installation

This project consists of 3 python scripts which should be downloaded from the github repository found here: [Practical 1 Repo](https://github.com/mjggibson4/Practical1 ""). These files should be saved to the users desktop

## Project Structure

The three files contained within this project have their own unique function.

GUI:  Sets up the graphical user interfaces from which the program is run. This interface allows for the initial parameters of the model to be edited as neccesary. 

Maincode: Define the logic behind the model itself.

Framework: Contains the classes from which the agents are defined. This framework dictates the behaviours of the agents such as how they move, eat and reproduce. 

## Usage

### From command line
1. Right click on the Desktop.
2. Select Open New Command Window Here
3. Type python GUI.py
4. Press enter

### From IDE
1. Open the file GUI in Spyder
2. Press Run

## Installation




## Acknowledgements

This project has been produced as part of coursework for the module: Programming for Geographical Information Analysts: Core Skills (WUN).  Exercises and tutorials given within this course have been modified as appropriate and used within the python code for this project. In addition, I'd like to give thanks to my course tutor Andy Turner who helped with issues encountered during development.
