# Population Model

## Description

This python based project a basic agents based model of predator prey dynamics. This this scenario these two competing agents have been defined as the of sheep and wolves. These agents move randomly around a defined domain and are allowed to interact with one another. In particular, these sheep agents "graze" their spatial eniviroment while the wolves if close enough consume these sheep. Both of these agents reproduce dependent on the resources on which they have consumed. This model provides a visual representation of these spatial dynamics and behaviours.
