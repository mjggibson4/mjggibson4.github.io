<h2>Biography</h2>
<p> <img src="ProfilePic.png" alt="Girl in a jacket" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-right:15px;"> I currently work as a GIS analyst within the nuclear industry. I have been in this role for the last 2.5 years. My day to day work involves heavy usage of GIS related software such as ArcMap, ArcPro and FME desktop. </p>



<p>Before gaining my current role, I had little to no GIS experience. Due to this, most of my GIS knowledge has been self taught via online materials. In 2018, I have undertook a MSc in GIS at the University of Leeds in order to transfer my self taught experience and knowledge into a tangible qualification. I am currently half way through this 3 year course and have so far enjoyed the technical challenges that it has presented. I have found that this course has been beneficial in refining my softer skills such as time management</p>



<h2>Career Aim</h2>

<p>My immediate career focus is concentrated on graduating my MSc in GIS in 2021. After this, I will be looking to become a chartered geographer with the AGI.</p>





<h3>Course Work Portfolio</h3>

<p> Please feel free to have a look at some of the work I have submitted towards my Masters degree. If you have any questions/ suggestion please do not hesitate to contact me using the provided details <a href="https://github.com/mjggibson4/Practical1">here</a></p> 




<h4>GIS and Python</h4> 
<h5>Population Model</h5>

<p>This python program simulates predator prey dynamics in a spatial domain. Tagents based model of predator prey dynamics. In this scenario these two competing agents have been defined as that of sheep and wolves. These agents move randomly around a defined domain and are allowed to interact with one another. In particular, these sheep agents "graze" their spatial eniviroment while the wolves consume these sheep if close enough
