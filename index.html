<h2>Biography</h2>

<p> <img style="padding: 20px; width:160px; height:220px" src="ProfilePic.png" alt="Profile Picture"> I currently work as a GIS analyst within the nuclear industry and I have been in this role for the last 2.5 years. The GIS team I am part of undertakes work which supports key strategic and tactical decisions for a very spatially constrained site. My day to day work involves heavy usage of GIS related software such as ArcMap, ArcPro and FME desktop. </p>

<p>Before gaining my current role, I had virtually no GIS experience. Due to this, most of my GIS knowledge has been self taught via online materials. In 2018, I undertook an MSc in GIS at the University of Leeds in order to boost my technical development and transfer my current knowledge and experience into a tangible qualification. I am currently half way through this 3 year course and have so far enjoyed the technical challenges that it has presented. Outside of work circles I am a keen golfer, football enthusiast and festival goer, </p>

 

<h4>Career Aim</h4>

<p>My immediate career focus is concentrated on graduating my MSc in GIS in 2021. After this, I am looking to become a chartered geographer with the AGI.</p>

<h2>Course Work Portfolio</h2>

<p> Please feel free to have a look at some of the work I have submitted towards my Masters degree. If you have any questions/ suggestions please don't hesitate to contact me using the provided details. </p>

<h4>GIS and Python</h4>

<h5>Population Model</h5>

<p><img src="RunGIF.gif" alt="Nodel GIF" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-right:15px;">This python program simulates predator prey dynamics within a spatial domain. In this scenario these two competing agents have been defined as that of sheep and wolves. These agents move randomly around a defined environment, reproduce and share resources with one another. This project can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/mjggibson4/Practical1">here</a>. </p>.

<h5>Bacterial Fallout Model</h5>

<p><img src="RunExample.PNG" alt="Model GIF" style="width:210px;height:178px;margin-right:15px;">This project models the potential resulting fallout from a bacterial bomb. This program releases a defined amount of particles within a domain and lets them move within three dimensions based on user defined wind probabilities. The landing location of each of these bacteria are recorded and output to a csv file. This project can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/mjggibson4/Practical2">here</a>. </p>.
