<h2>Biography</h2>
<p> <img src="ProfilePic.png" alt="Girl in a jacket" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-right:15px;"> I currently work as a GIS analyst within the nuclear industry and I have been in this role for the last 2.5 years. The GIS team I am part of undertakes work which supports key strategic and tactical decisions for a very spatially constrained site. My day to day work involves heavy usage of GIS related software such as ArcMap, ArcPro and FME desktop. </p>



<p>Before gaining my current role, I had virtually no GIS experience. Due to this, most of my GIS knowledge has been self taught via online materials. In 2018, I undertook an MSc in GIS at the University of Leeds in order to boost my technical development and transfer my current knowledge and experience into a tangible qualification. I am currently half way through this 3 year course and have so far enjoyed the technical challenges that it has presented. </p
  
<p>Outside of work circles I am a keen golfer, football enthusiast and festival goer</p>  



<h2>Career Aim</h2>

<p>My immediate career focus is concentrated on graduating my MSc in GIS in 2021. After this, I am looking to become a chartered geographer with the AGI.</p>
