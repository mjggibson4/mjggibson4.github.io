<h1>Biography</h1>
<p>I currently work as a GIS analyst within the nuclear industry. I have been in this role for the last 2.5 years. My day to day work involves heavy usage of GIS related software such as ArcMap, ArcPro and FME desktop. This role has been exciting for myself in terms of technical development as it has exposed me to many new technologies. </p>

<p>Before gaining my current role, I had little to no GIS experience. However, I have a keen passion for digital technologies anowledge has been self taught. Due to this, I have undertaken a MSc in GIS at the University of Leeds in order to justify this education. I am currently half way through this 3 year course and have so far enjoyed the technical challenges that it has presented. </p>

<h1>Career Aim</h1>
<p>My immediate focus is concentrated on graduating from my distance learning masters in 2021.</p>
