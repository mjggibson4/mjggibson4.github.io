<p>I currently work as a GIS analyst within the nuclear industry. I have been in this role for the last 2.5 years. My day to day work involves heavy usage of GIS related software such as ArcMap, ArcPro and FME desktop. </p>

<p>Before gaining my current role, I had little to no GIS experience. Due to this, most of my GIS knowledge has been self taught via online materials. In 2018, I have undertook a MSc in GIS at the University of Leeds in order to transfer my self taught experience and knowledge into a tangible qualification. I am currently half way through this 3 year course and have so far enjoyed the technical challenges that it has presented. I have found that this course has been beneficial in refining my softer skills such as time management</p>

<h1>Career Aim</h1>
<p>My immediate career focus is concentrated on graduating my MSc in GIS in 2021. After this, I will be looking to become a chartered geographer with the AGI.</p>
